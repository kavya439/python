*Minimalpassword generator*

This Python program generates a random password consisting of letters, numbers, and special characters. It uses the random and string modules to build a password of a specified length. By default, the password length is 8 characters, but the user can modify it.

The function generate_password() works by combining all possible characters—uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation—and then randomly selecting characters from this pool to create a password. The result is a strong, randomized password that can be used for securing user accounts or systems.
